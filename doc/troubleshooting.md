## I press a key and nothing happens!

First of all, make sure the key has a script mapped to it.

If in doubt, use one of the sample profiles.

### If *none* of the keys work

* Check you're using the **top USB-C port**, NOT the one next to the screen!

* Check that the cable is plugged all the way in.

* Try a different cable (some don't have data pins).

* Try a different USB port.

* Try using a USB hub.

* Try a different computer.

### If a certain key doesn't work

Take off the switch and inspect the pins, chances are one of them is bent:

Straighten it up with a pair of pliers, then insert again.

Make sure the **pins are straight** and aim for hot-swap socket holes.

## Rotary encoder pushbutton doesn't work!

Some knobs have a hole that's slightly too deep, making it bottom out before the pushbutton fully activates.

To Fix:

* Pull off the knob

* Stuff a tiny amount of paper tissue into the hole

* Reinstall

## Letters and symbols come out wrong!

* **Long-press** `+` button

* Select the correct keyboard layout

* Press any unlit key to save & quit

* [Optional] Read more about [how keymaps work](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/keymap_instructions.md)

## My script behaves inconsistently!

duckyPad might be typing too fast for your computer.

Slow it down with the following commands:

* `DELAY n` adds an arbitrary delay in milliseconds.

* `DEFAULTDELAY n` sets how long to wait between **`each line`** of code.

* `DEFAULTCHARDELAY n` sets how long to wait between **`each keystroke`**.

* Default is 20ms, try 50 if too fast. Set it at the very beginning of script.

## I want to use my own SD card!

* Mount the SD card on PC
* Format it in `FAT or FAT32`:

* Press `Backup...` button in the configurator

![Alt text](../resources/photos/trouble/backup.png)

* Select a backup and copy files back to the **root of your SD card**

![Alt text](../resources/photos/trouble/sample_pf.png)

* You can also download the [sample profiles](../resources/sample_profiles/sample_profiles.zip) and start fresh

## The RGB backlight is flickering slightly!

* Make sure the USB port can provide enough power

* Use a high-quality cable

## The RGB backlight is too bright!

* Adjust the brightness by **long-pressing `+` button**.

## Will OLED suffer burn-in?

Measures have been taken to prevent burn-in.

* Screen dims after 1 minute.

* duckyPad goes to sleep after 15 minutes (adjustable).

## I want to replace the OLED screen!

* [Follow this guide in reverse](troubleshooting.md) until PCB is removed

* **Slowly and gently** push the black tabs outwards

![Alt text](../resources/photos/trouble/oled.jpeg)

* Gently pull on the ribbon cable to release

* Use a hair dryer on the screen to soften the adhesive

* Insert something thin underneath the OLED to pry it up

* Clean off any residues 

* Line up the new screen to the guide line, and stick it on.

* Insert the ribbon cable into connector, the gold contact should be barely visible (see photo above).

* Push the black tab back in.

* Try it out and reassemble!

## Numpad keys doesn't work!

Make sure `NUMLOCK` is on.
