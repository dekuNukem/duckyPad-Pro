## Tools

A small **Phillips-head screwdriver** (`+`shape) is needed. One should be provided in the package.

A **pair of pliers** also helps, but not required.

## Handling PCB

When handling the bare circuit board, remember to:

* Wash your hands first

* Always hold by its edge

* Don't touch the components

## Assembly Steps

Place **something rigid** against the back, and flip over. The screws should stay in place.

Thread on **2.5mm spacers**.

**Moderately** tighten, use pliers if available.

It shouldn't rattle when shaken.
