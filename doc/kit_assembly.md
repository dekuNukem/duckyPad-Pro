## Tools

A small **Phillips-head screwdriver** (`+`shape) should be provided in the package.

A 3mm socket bit or **pair of pliers** also helps, but not required.

## Assembly Steps

----------

Before we start, **go wash your hands** to discharge static electricity.

First, the antenna cable.

Look at the back of the PCB. Identify the sockets:

Match the receptacles, push **straight down**. 

If too tight, put some cushioning on the other side, and use the **flat end of a pen** for more leverage.

Always push **straight down**, careful not to slip and damage nearby components.

It should click in place. Check it's fully seated.

Adjust the cable to avoid overlapping any components.

Hold the `Back Plate` **in the orientation shown**.

Insert `8mm` and `3mm` screws.

Place **something rigid** against the back, and flip over. The screws should stay in place.

Put on **3mm spacers** (the slightly shorter one)

Moderately tighten, with pliers if available. It shouldn't rattle when shaken.

Install the circuit board, then `4mm spacers`.

* Moderately tighten

* Avoid scratching the PCB or nearby components

Offer up the `top plate`, place the `3mm screws`, **loosely** at first.

Ensure it is **properly aligned**, then tighten all.
