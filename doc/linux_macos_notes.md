[Get duckyPad Pro](https://www.tindie.com/products/37399/) | [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5) | [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) | [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---------

On macOS, you can run the configurator as a **pre-packaged app**, or execute the **source code** directly.

## Pre-packaged App

* [Download the latest macOS release here](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad-Pro/releases/latest)

* Double click to unzip

* **Right Click** on the folder, select `New Terminal at Folder`

![The right click menu with the option “New Terminal at Folder” higlighted.](../resources/photos/app/term.png)

* Type `sh ./run.sh`, press enter.

![The text to run the configurator shown in a terminal window.](../resources/photos/app/run.png)

* Authenticate. Your password will be hidden in the terminal, the letters won't appear but press enter and the configurator should launch!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should use this to start the application every time, it grants the configurator permission to connect to the duckypad.

---------

* If macOS complains about unsigned app

* Go to Settings > Privacy & Security

* Scroll down to security section and click "Allow Anyway" 

![Warning pop-up with the text: “‘duckypad_config’ cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.”](../resources/photos/app/unknown.png)

![Settings screen in Privacy & Security, the warning “‘duckypad_config’ was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer,” is shown above a button with the text “Allow Anyway”.](../resources/photos/app/perf.png)

---------

* If the configurator complains “duckypad detected, but I need additional permissions” then you should grant the Terminal app permissions for “Input Monitoring”. This is one of the sub-menus in the Privacy & Security screen.

  ![Error pop-up with the text “duckypad detected, but I need additional permissions” and three options: Yes, No, and Cancel.](../resources/photos/app/detected-but-additional-permissions.png)
  
  ![Input Monitoring settings granted to the Terminal and configurator app](../resources/photos/app/input-monitoring.png)

* Other users have needed to grant the configurator and Terminal permissions for “Full Disk Access” or “Developer Tools”.

* If everything fails, you can also edit your duckypad by manually entering USB mount mode (hold +, select key 6) and selecting the newly mounted SD card. Be careful, this will fail to properly eject the SD card before restarting the duckypad which may corrupt it, and macOS will complain about this.

## Run from Source

* [Download the latest source release here](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad-Pro/releases/latest)
* Double click to unzip
* **Right Click** on the folder, select `New Terminal at Folder`

----

* Use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install python-tk: `brew install python-tk`
* **[Optional]** Make a virtualenv and activate it: `python3 -m venv .venv; source .venv/bin/activate`
* Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Launch the app: `sudo python3 ./duckypad_config.py`
